[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

The intention of Yaz is to, eventually, explore what it would be like to work with an ncurses-like JS library (Blessed) from ClojureScript. At the moment, all that exists is a POC that Blessed can be built into a Node-based ClojureScript project.
